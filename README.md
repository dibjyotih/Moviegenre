# Movie Genre
# Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between movies and their respective genres using data from multiple text files. We aim to uncover insights into genre popularity, movie trends, and other relevant patterns in the movie industry.

The data used in this project comes from three different Text files:

test_data.txt
test_data_solution.txt
train_data.txt
The files are merged into a single, comprehensive data file for analysis. Various data cleaning and preparation techniques were applied to ensure consistency and accuracy. The project leverages Python (Pandas and NumPy) for data manipulation and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to present key findings.

# Key Features
Data Merging: Combining multiple sources of data into a unified dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends in movie genres and their correlations with factors like audience ratings, release year, and critic scores.
Visualization: Presenting data trends through graphs and charts to make insights easier to understand.
# Conclusion and Outcomes
After analyzing the merged dataset, several interesting patterns were identified:

Genre Popularity: Action, Drama, and Comedy emerged as the most common genres, while niche genres like Documentary and Western were relatively rare.
Ratings and Genres: Drama and Documentary movies tended to have higher average ratings from critics, while Comedy and Action films showed more variability in audience ratings.
Trend Over Time: There was a noticeable shift in genre preferences over the decades, with Action and Sci-Fi gaining prominence in recent years.
These findings provide valuable insights into movie genre trends, helping us better understand both consumer preferences and how the movie industry has evolved over time.
